# {title}

This is the short story why I created this website you are currently using.
I will also introduce you to the future of this site and spoiler some content that will be created as part of this journey.

## First of all why *ON THE FCKNG EARTH* do I write in English?

To make it short, **AUDIENCE**. The audience is much greater if I write in English than in *German*.
Obvisouly I could just let ``<insert absolutely most creative LLM of your choice>`` write my content or at least translate it.
**BUT,** I'm here to learn stuff.
I want to extend my vocabulary and get more fluent in English.
I assumed if I write regularely, I **MUST** get better at some point.
Maybe I will read this post in on year and realize, I did not earn one skill point. *But at least I tried.*

Furthermore most documentation of code and tech in general is found in English. So I want to be part of this community.

## What happend that motivated me to create a personal website?

Obvisouly there is not only one reason why I decided to create a personal website.
I will write about multiple aspects that lead to the decision to start building it.

### Psychological Reason

All started with a really dark period in my life. I lost all motivation. I was trying to keep the illusion up of being flawless.
I was trying to keep up with technology. Getting better at everything. Trying to solve problems of other people instead of mine.
I had to cover up all my shortcomings.
I invested my whole day and all my energy into seeking recognition. I couldn't ask for help. Everything pulled me into a downward spiral.
I havent slept for days, missed meals regularely for weeks, skipped my workouts *(and even worse; worked out in an unhealthy and painful way)*,
did not talk to any friends, developed panic attacks and finally **I broke.**

A long unhealthy period ended with my breakdown. I couldn't cope anymore. I was feeling empty. I was finally ready to ask for help.
And I got the help I required. I'm still work in progress. But I'm on a good path. **I want to fight my perfectionism.** This is why I want to share
my projects online. To ask for feedback. I need to learn mistakes are okay. I need to learn that I can change direction at any time, if I realize
I'm on the wrong path.
I need to learn **nothing will ever be perfect.**

### Motivational Reason

One reason why perfectionism killed me, was my personal goals got higher and harder to reach. **My self-esteem got lower every day
and my goals were opposing the drop in my self esteem**. Therefore I needed to work harder every day to componsate.

I want to change this thinking. We need to break down large projects into smaller ones. Working in an **agile manner**.
Celebrate the accomplishment of reaching milestones to keep the motivation up. Asking users and customers for feedback
to define the route for a better project. **Only if I see any progress, I will stay committed**.

Overcomplicated or overplanned projects will only make it harder to start at the beginning. The enormous pile of required work
gets too large. So I can't see a path to climb it. I get overwhelmed and the project dies in the planning phase.

So I break down projects into **bloggable content**. Each change should be graspable in one blog post. Then it stays small
and I can handle it.

### Community Reason

I'm in love with the open source community. Even if I haven't committed much in the past.
Thinking about people all over the world working together **FOR FREE** to accomplish something greater, heals my broken heart.

Most cooperations are only possible because of open source software. But only a small part of them is ready to give something back.
This is really sad. I want to be part of a better world. *I'm against the capitalist model that prioritizes profit over the people
and the planet.*

I want to connect with people that contribute to free and open code. I want to work together with people that invest time, energy
and knowledge into a project without getting max profit of it. It is okay to earn money but it always depends.

### Career and Resumee Reason

I like the idea of working on my projects and sharing about them to **keep my résumé up to date automatically**.
Head hunters and HR departments should get a good overview about my motivation and my skillset by visiting my website.
Or maybe future customers of my own company will be able to see first-hand how I work. **I want to create transparency.**

## What are THE topics I will write about?

Now that you know enough about my history, motivation and core ideas; what will I write about in the future?
I love to learn new stuff. I love to **CREATE** and **BUILD**. In the past I wasn't able to do that because
of my personal problems. But now I want to change that.

I will write about the journey of my website.

- Having almost no experience with frontend to building a website
- How to get better at writing
- How to use SEO to reach a broader audience
- How to create a earning from a website?
- Creating content for others to learn new these topics
- Hosting without being depended on large US cooperations

Also all future projects will be part of my blog posts. Some ideas will be mentioned in the next section

Maybe I will also write more about more personal and non tech related topics

- Personal Development
- Fitness Journey
- Book Reviews
- Self-Employment

## Do I already have some project ideas?

I have an enormous amount of ideas. I need to evaluate which I will postpone and which I want to focus now.
The topics in this section should already be filtered. More projects will follow!

- As already mentioned building my personal website (join my journey as a frontend newbie)
- Hosting and Building in the EU (with scaleway)
- Collecting and visualizing Metrics in different contexts (tech related with OpenTelemtry, but also personal related with running and weight lifting):
*As most programmers (i guess) I'm deeply in love with data*
- I want to learn **GO** and **Distributed Systems**
- I usually work with **neovim** but me setup is really outdated. So maybe I will write about my setup
- And my personal most loved topic. **IoT** and **Data Engineering**. I love the combination of collecting data and solve problems for the real world.

## OOF that got longer than I expected

Remember at the beginning: "This is the **short story** ..."?
It got deeper than I imagined. I'm sorry. But as you know now, I'm a perfectionist.
(*YEA I'm working on it. I swear*)
So it took my a really long time to write an be satisfied with it.
Hopefully you got a good overview about my motivation and will follow my journey
into my future. Maybe you will be a part of it.
